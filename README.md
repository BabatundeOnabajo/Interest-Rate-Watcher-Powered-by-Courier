The interest rate set by a country's central bank is perhaps one of the most important economic policies in a country. It influences the interest rates charged on credit cards, mortgages, car loans, overdraft charges and much more. The interest rate forms one part of what is known as "monetary policy", which refers to the set of policies that a central bank uses to influence an economy. Despite the importance of the interest rate set by a central bank, only a minority of people would be able to state what the current interest rate set by their country's central bank is.
